# CollegeCompass Capstone Project

Tanner Martz and Devin Gutierrez
Advised by Dr. Hassan and Dr. Maus

This is Milestone 03 for the Computer Science Coordinate Major at Tulane University.
Our project is a web application that is an imporvement on the current degree audit that is offered to students.
The improvements include better visualization so students can plan their courses better, and a more user friendly interface.
This greatly improves the experience of students and advisors when planning out a student's academic career.
This also may be used by prospective students to visualize their potential college path.
This also may be used by upperclassmen to view their past progress looking forward to their career plans after college.
